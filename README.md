# AutoEnroll

AutoEnroll is a Python script that automates the process of signing up for courses at your university. It uses Selenium with a headless browser to perform the enrollment process silently in the background, allowing you to use your computer for other tasks while it runs.

## Usage

1. **Download:** Clone or download the script from [devthekar.github.io](https://devthekar.github.io/AutoEnroll.py).

2. **Dependencies:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install Selenium and the appropriate WebDriver for your chosen browser (e.g., Chrome WebDriver).

3. **Configuration:** Edit the script to include your university's course enrollment page URL and any necessary login credentials.

4. **Run the Script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run it using Python:

    ```bash
    python AutoEnroll.py
    ```

5. **Sit Back and Relax:** The script will automate the course enrollment process in the background, allowing you to use your computer for other tasks.

## Disclaimer

Please use this script responsibly and in accordance with your university's policies and guidelines regarding course enrollment. Automated enrollment may not be permitted in some cases, so make sure to verify the legality and ethical implications of using this script at your institution.
